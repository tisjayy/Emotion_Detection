# ResNet-Based Real-Time Emotion Detection

This project implements a ResNet-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify human emotions from facial images in real time. The model is trained on the FER2013 dataset and integrated with OpenCV to capture live webcam input.

## Features
- Trains a custom ResNet-based CNN with L2 regularization and batch normalization.
- Achieves **75% test accuracy** on FER2013 after 40 epochs.
- Real-time emotion recognition with webcam using OpenCV.
- Uses **data augmentation** and experiment tracking with **MLflow**.

## Emotion Classes
The model classifies facial expressions into **7 emotion categories**:

- Angry  
- Disgust  
- Fear  
- Happy  
- Sad  
- Surprise  
- Neutral  

 

## Dataset
The project uses the [FER2013 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013).  
Training and testing data are stored as CSV files (`train.csv` and `test.csv`).
## Docker + Azure
- Containerized the Streamlit-based emotion detection app with Docker, ensuring consistent environment and dependencies.

- Tested the container locally by running docker build and docker run -p 8501:8501 to validate real-time inference performance.

- Deployed the Docker image to Azure Container Apps, enabling remote access via a public URL.

- Optimized deployment for real-time video streaming (Streamlit + WebRTC) while maintaining <100â€¯ms inference per frame.

It is recommended to run this application locally on your computer rather than online deployments (e.g., Streamlit Cloud or Azure) because:

- Online platforms compress video streams, which reduces image quality and causes frame rate drops.

- The app uses Haar Cascade for face tracking, which is an older technique and may not work well with low-resolution or compressed video feeds.

- Running locally provides better performance, real-time response, and higher detection accuracy.

## Requirements
- everything in requirements.txt
- use python 3.10 and set up a virtual environment.
- webcam

Install the dependencies:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas tensorflow keras opencv-python scikit-learn mlflow
python emotion_recognition_final.py 
python face_tracking.py
